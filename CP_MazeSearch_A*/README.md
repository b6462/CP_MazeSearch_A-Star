this is a class project

-a maze search program based on A* algorithm

-#Features:

1)maze creation(customizable maze scale\dig regularity\entrance position)

2)A* search algorithm-1

3)A* search algorithm-2(spcificly designed for MicroMouse maze-search\practical use)

4)debug mode(display every step)

-NOTE: 

1)This program is jancky, and lacks refinement-which may improve in the future.

2)Most of it's debugging features and annotations are in Chinese.
